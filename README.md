UCLA ASA DataFest - 2020 Challenge

The UCLA ASA DataFest invites you to tell us a story about how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world other than its effect on direct health outcomes.  Effects of the pandemic on issues like unemployment, travel, energy use, working from home, education moving online, tracking and privacy, etc. are felt all across the globe. The challenge for this DataFest is 
choose an outcome such as one of these (or something entirely different we haven’t thought of here!), 
find the appropriate data to explore the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on this issue, and
present your findings (along with the dataset you used).

We ask that participants not focus on predicting infection, mortality, and recovery rates since modeling these outcomes requires an epidemiological background that many of us don't have. Additionally, the data on these outcomes is not very reliable and we don’t want anyone reaching conclusions that might potentially be harmful, especially if shared widely. 
 
Many scientists, journalists, hobbyists, etc. have been sharing the results of their analysis of COVID-19 data either as peer reviewed research or as artifacts published on the web. We want you to do your research about what is out there and push yourself to develop a novel look at the data or a novel insight. Below are a few suggestions to get you started, but you should feel welcomed to focus on a question different than these.
How has the pandemic affected the airline industry and what are some potential downstream effects of this other than economic strain on the industry?
As a student, how would you quantify the effect of the pandemic on your education?
With shelter in place / lockdown in place, many workers have started working from home, which requires internet access. How prepared was the nation / your local area for this shift?
How has the spread of the pandemic affected people’s opinion on government tracking and privacy?
What is the effect of the social distancing / shelter in place / lockdown recommendations and policies on pollution?
How can we quantify the potential effects on nutrition and general health of the public, outside of those affected by the virus?
How are refugees affected by COVID-19?
This challenge involves finding your own dataset, but a few pointers might be helpful to get a sense of what type of datasets might work. We list a few options below, but once again, you are highly encouraged to work with datasets different from these.
